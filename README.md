# Task List manager

This project is my first project at John Bryce. It is a simple web application for managing your to-do list. You can add tasks with details and deadlines, and they will be displayed as "sticky notes" on the screen. The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


## Features

- Add tasks with details and deadlines
- Display tasks as "sticky notes" on the screen
- Remove tasks by clicking on the "X" button on each sticky note
- Data is stored in the browser's local storage, so tasks persist even after refreshing the page

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Fill in the task details and deadline in the form.
4. Click the "Add Task" button to add the task.
5. The task will be displayed as a sticky note on the screen.
6. To remove a task, click the "X" button on the corresponding sticky note.
7. Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they will persist even after refreshing the page.
